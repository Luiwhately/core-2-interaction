      </a>
      <p>When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely
        right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use
        a semicolon, you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing.</p>

      <p id="bottom-border">The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a
        primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.” Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly
        uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written
        long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.</p>

        <h3>The Most Important Lesson for a Poet</h3><h5>read more in pg.5</h5>
      </a>
      <div class="flex-container" id="bottom-border">
        <div style="flex-grow: 1"  id="flex-grow1">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin,
          the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen,
          heard, witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young poets recognize this to be one of
          the most important lessons they can learn: if you have any idea for a poem, </div>
          <div style="flex-grow: 1" id="flex-grow1"> an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley,
          at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and
          error. I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too
          loudly, they will get the wrong idea.</div>

        <h3>The Creation of Tension</h3><h5>read more in pg.10</h5>
      </a>
      <div class="flex-container" id="bottom-border">
        <div style="flex-grow: 1" id="flex-grow1">

          Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: “Perhaps all we can
          say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all
          our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also
          released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those
          expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”  But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems
          begin. How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly
          like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the
          universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge,
          and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. 
          I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures,
          across aesthetic schools,</div>
        <div style="flex-grow: 1" id="flex-grow1"> and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even
          repeated, and that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain
          remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, reading
          these first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each
          speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we
          listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same: in poem after poem
          I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night
          after night, like a refrain: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. And I
          encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: I love you.
          I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. </div>

          Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use at a standing-up-only party when
          everyone is tired of hearing there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the
          Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some Languages
          are so constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime.</div>
        <div style="flex-grow: 1" id="flex-grow1"> Thatsentence begins with your first words, toddling around the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before
          you step into the limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. Or, if you are
          blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.
