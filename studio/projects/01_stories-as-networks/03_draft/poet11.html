            <h3>Not Every Poem Is Finished</h3>

                In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it. <br> <br>

                In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finishedâ€”one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.
