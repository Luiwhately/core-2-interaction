                 Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it:
                 
                 “the opening line of a poem, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.”
