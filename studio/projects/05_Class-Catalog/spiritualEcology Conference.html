    <h1>Spiritual Ecology Conference</h1>
    <div class="projectExplanation">
        This website is a invitation to people to participate at a Spiritual Ecology Conference happening in the UK. To
        bring the connection to Eath, this website is connected to a London Sunset API that indicates how many hours
        are to the next sunset in the event location. The idea is for users to use the golden hour to disconect
        from daily demands and enjoy simply being present.<br>

        The page elements shadow respond to the API in realation to the sun position during the day.<br>

        The website also meets a goal of being a low impact website, with a A+ grade, and being 98% cleaner than avarage
        websites. To do that, the website uses a color pallet that uses low energy to be displayed and no videos, images
        or animations, only css and svgs.
